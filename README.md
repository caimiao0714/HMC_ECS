# HMCECS
Sample code for HMC-ECS.
This is the code to run a logistic regression. The code is used for the examples in our paper, "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Energy Conserving Subsampling". The paper has been published in JMLR http://jmlr.org/papers/v20/17-452.html  
To run the example, please look at "main.py". Please note that this code was written in Python 2.7
